Here's an <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/article/print?articleId=232600389&amp;siteSectionName=testing">article</a> from Dr. Dobb's written by Cedric Beust. He is the author of TestNG, and wrote it back in the days of Junit3 to address the issues of Junit3.

Junit has adopted a number of the items TestNG first introduced, but TestNG still has a lot to offer. Cedric has written a brief overview article showing some powerful features.

And a link to <a href="testng.org">TestNG</a>.
