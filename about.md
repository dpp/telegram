# About
Welcome to my collection of things I either don't want to forget or things I wanted to write about.

I'm a software developer and have been in the industry for 20+years. By day, I'm a Java J2EE developer, developing websites for my employer's clients. By night, I'm learning some new technology to keep my skills sharp.

I'm also a strong advocate of DVCS's. If you're still using Subversion, and you make mistakes in commit messages, want to merge branches with greater ease, want to put changes aside temporarily without having to manage patches, then this is some of what a DVCS can provide you.
